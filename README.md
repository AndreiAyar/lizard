## What is this?

- A funny desktop app that turns your typing into... lizard noises.  
- Inspired by the latest lizard meme (you know the one).
- It's fun, maybe even a little bit cursed.

## Techy Stuff

- Written in **Python** and **Svelte**.
- Runs as a desktop app thanks to **Tauri** (so fast, so light, so lizard).
- Install dependencies:  
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```
- Run in dev mode (to debug your lizard):  
  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```
- Build for production (for serious lizard business):  
  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```

## Why?

Because the world needs more lizard keyboard sounds.  
Because memes.

## Contributing
